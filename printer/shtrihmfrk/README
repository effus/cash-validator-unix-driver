To read all data from port buffer call
	./shtrih-mfk.bin read
This procedure is infinitive, so to stop procedure, press Ctrl+C

To setup device speed, call
	./shtrih-mfk.bin setupspeed <current> <new>
	
To check connect call
	./shtrih-mfk.bin check

2. USE

Call ./run.bash to execute daemon. If its already 
started, script return "DONE". If its just started,
return "RUN". If not then return "FAIL".

When its starts, all commands should be sending throught 
controller called "printer.bin", which return "TRUE" if
device make all commands, and "FAIL" if not.

There are 7 commands.
 
1. Test mode. 
	Call "./printer.bin test", and daemon send to device 
	command 13h("BEEP"), that you can hear.
	
2. Stop mode.
	Call "./printer.bin stop" to terminate daemon.
	
3. Print selftest information.
	Call "./printer.bin ptest". Device start printing
	various information by command 19h("TEST").

4. Close day
	Call "./printer.bin closesmena" to close day and store 
	report to memory. Command is C6h ("Daily report with 
	cleaning to buffer"). Need to call every 12:00 a.m.

5. New payment
	Call "./printer.bin newpayment <price> '<text>'" to 
	make payment operation.
	At first, controller sends command 8Dh ("open check").
	Then 80h ("sale") with information about price and 
	service name.
	Then 85h ("close check")

6. Check mode
	Call "./printer getmode". Return "MODE:<number>" which 
	indicate FR mode or "FAIL" if error.

7. Incassation
	Call "./printer incass" to print all Z-reports from 
	FR buffer. Need to print every 4 days.
